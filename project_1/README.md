## Project 1 Chuwen Liu
### Background
The dataset shows some variables that represent support for the people in need by Urban Ministries of Durham. The Ministries record data around 90 years so that we could explore some interesting phenomenon.I think the variable "date", "client file number" and "food pounds" will be useful in my project, which will show the tendency of food supply. we will explore more such as school kits whose sample size isn't that large.
### Research Problem and method
I am kind of interested in the changing trend of demand for food, clothing items and school kits, and their potential correlation. Will them be related to the months (seasons)? I am also interested whether there's any association between different variables, such as diapers and school kits. It might have some similar change with a time difference; At last, I would like to explore the amount of total clients and new clients in 21 century, inferring if the support by UMD have really reduced the amount of clients every year. By observing the client who went to UMD the most time, we could infer that what kind of help clients usually seek for.

In addition, We would like to conduct an interesting research on what's the most frequent words in "note of service", which will help us better understand the overall demand of clients.

We will mainly use tidyverse function to do some data analysis work, using ggplot to show the result.
