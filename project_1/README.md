## Project 1 Chuwen Liu
The dataset shows some variables that provide support for the poor people by Urban Ministries of Durham. I think the variable "date", "client file number" and "food pounds" will be useful in my project.
I am kind of interested in the age composition of the clients, and the trend of demand for food, clothing items and school kits as the time change. I am also interested whether there's any association between different variables, such as diapers and school kits. At last, I would like to infer if the support by UMD have really helped the client, keeping them out of poverty. I will use some time series analysis and draw some plot
