# Project 3 

## Background 

The dataset shows some variables that represent support for the people in need by Urban Ministries of Durham, whose aim is to help ending the homeless in the neighborhood. We have more different kind of datasets from more different dimensions than the last two projects. These datasets are about shelter, mainly about the data comparison of clients who enter and exit from the shelter, such as the source of clients' income, the status of disability, the demographic(age, gender, race...) of the clients, and the health insurance. we could explore some potential phenomenon based on the summary of entry data and exit data.


## Problem

I might consider the problems below:
* The Duration of staying at shelter for different clients: will it be linked to some variables such as income, health insurance or living situation at entry? We might build a model to predict the future clients' staying time in shelter based on his character.
* We will explore the change of some variables at exit regarding the variables at entry. What kind of help did the UMD shelter provide?
* Is there any trend of entering shelter regarding the month? We will check the time trend to suggest if UMD should make some extra preparation in some period. Also, we will check how many times the clients usually visits shelters and make a summary about the time lag between two visits.

## Method

We will use pandas in python to perform Data Wrangling, and will use tidyverse to show some conclusions and draw plots. Docker and Make will be used in helping reproduce the running procedure and document the whole project.
