# Project 2 

## Background
The dataset shows some variables that represent support for the people in need by Urban Ministries of Durham, whose aim is to help ending the homeless in the neighborhood. The range of recorded data is around 90 years so that we could explore some interesting phenomenon. We will use the dataset provided by UMD to create a Shiny dashboard to try to help people find the solution on their interesting questions.

## Potential Questions
I would like to explore some of the questions below:
* The trend of different supplies changing by year, month, week and day, especially food supply.
* For those who are in the nth(1-1000) place in the list of the person-time who received help from UMD, we would like to see the time interval of their seeking for help, and explore the changing trend of supplies demand.
* I would show different changing tendency plot among any two variables we select to search for their correlation. Also, I will consider the influence brought by quarters. People could selet the quarters they want to see if there's any association between variables and quarters.

## Methods

I will use shiny Dashboard to finish some visualization work, showing a more user-friendly interface to allow the user explore the data by their own, and mainly use ggplot2 to show our result. Since the encoding environment problem, I could not deploy the app in my own computer, and I feel sorry about the possible confusion.

## Result
