# Project 2 draft

## Background
The dataset shows some variables that represent support for the people in need by Urban Ministries of Durham, whose aim is to help ending the homeless in the neighborhood. The Ministries record data around 90 years so that we could explore some interesting phenomenon. We will use the dataset provided by UMD to create a Shiny dashboard to try to help people find the solution on their interesting questions.

## Potential Questions
I would like to explore some of the questions below:
* The trend of different supplies changing with year, month and week, especially food supply.
* For those who rank top 10 in the list of the person-time who received help from UMD, we would like to see the time interval of their seeking for help, and explore the changing trend of supplies demand.
* If possible, with some external source data like temperature change, we would like to search for the association between the weather and other items supply.
* I would show different chenging tendency plot among any two variables we select.

## Methods

I will use shiny Dashboard to finish some visualization work, showing a more user-friendly interface to allow the user explore the data by their own. Also, I might introduce additional data source to help me finish the project.
